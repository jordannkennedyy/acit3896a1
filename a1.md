1. in this assignment I will deduce the asymptotic complexity (average-case) of a number of programs by running experiments, and writing a report.

2. ABOUT
    a. Routines contains each routine script, 1-5. Fut is the routine that I am going to measure within each routine script.
    b. Created_functions contains functions I have created to assist in data collection.
        - final collection: takes the case, and an increment. The increment is fed into the casemaker, and will iterate until it reaches the case
        - after each iteration, a time will be collected and added to collect_time_list_of_dictionaries list.
    c. overnight.bash is a script that will run overnight, and execute each routine .py one after the other.
   d. My terminal output was reading and writing to csv files.
